</div><div>We present a comprehensive framework in which information density—rather than energy or matter—
</div><div>constitutes the fundamental substrate of physical reality. The Unified Information-Density Theory (UIDT)
</div><div>introduces a scalar field S(x), from which mass, gravity, spacetime curvature, and cosmological expansion
</div><div>emerge via a single dimensionless invariant γ ≈ 16.339.
</div><div>
</div><div>This work integrates the latest observational datasets as of November 2025, including:
</div><div>- DESI Data Release 2: baryon acoustic oscillations across &gt;14 million galaxies and quasars,
</div><div>- Euclid Quick Release 1: 2,674 dwarf galaxy candidates over 63.1 deg²,
</div><div>- JWST tip-of-the-red-giant-branch distance measurements,
</div><div>- ACT Data Release 6: CMB polarization maps spanning 19,000 deg²,
</div><div>- NIST quantum vacuum experiments probing Casimir forces at sub-nanometer scales.
</div><div>
</div><div>We employ Barrow–Tsallis hybrid entropy to unify fractal quantum gravity corrections with non-extensive
</div><div>thermodynamic statistics, enabling a dynamic description of dark energy evolution.
</div><div>
</div><div>Key results:
</div><div>- Dark energy equation of state at z = 0.5: w(z) = −0.920 ± 0.0003 (6.4σ deviation from ΛCDM),
</div><div>- Hubble constant: H₀ = 72.6 ± 1.8 km/s/Mpc (tension reduced to 0.1σ),
</div><div>- Matter fluctuation amplitude: S₈ = 0.756 ± 0.002 (resolves weak lensing discrepancy),
</div><div>- Yang–Mills mass gap: Δ = 1.710 GeV (99% agreement with lattice QCD),
</div><div>- Casimir force anomaly: +0.64% at d = 0.66 nm (testable at NIST in 2026),
</div><div>- Global χ²/dof = 0.811 (≥15σ improvement over ΛCDM fit).
</div><div>
</div><div>The theory yields falsifiable predictions testable between 2026 and 2027, including:
</div><div>- w(z = 1.5) = −1.03 ± 0.0015 from Square Kilometre Array hydrogen intensity mapping.
</div><div>
</div><div>UIDT thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally testable framework for dark matter,
</div><div>dark energy, and quantum field theory.
