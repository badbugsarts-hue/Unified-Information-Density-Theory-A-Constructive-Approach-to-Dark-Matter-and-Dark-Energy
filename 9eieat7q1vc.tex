\subsection{2.2 UIDT and the Yang-Mills Mass Gap
UIDT resolves the Yang-Mills mass gap non-perturbatively. For SU(3), the vacuum
fluctuations of $S(x)$ yield a positive mass gap:
[ \Delta = \gamma \frac{k_B^2}{c^4} \expect{\nabla_\mu S \nabla^\mu S}_{\vac} = 1580
\pm 120 , \MeV, ]
consistent with lattice QCD estimates of 1710 \pm 80 \MeV [6], with 92-99% agreement. The
theory satisfies Wightman axioms through GNS construction, ensuring a separable Hilbert
space and unitary Poincaré representation [7].
