<h1 data-label="790895" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract</h1><div>We present a comprehensive framework in which information density—rather than energy or matter—constitutes the fundamental substrate of physical reality. The Unified Information-Density Theory (UIDT) introduces a scalar field S(x), from which mass, gravity, spacetime curvature, and cosmological expansion emerge via a single dimensionless invariant γ ≈ 16.339.</div><div>This work integrates the latest observational datasets as of November 2025, including DESI Data Release 2 (baryon acoustic oscillations across over 14 million galaxies and quasars), Euclid Quick Release 1 (2,674 dwarf galaxy candidates across 63.1 square degrees), JWST tip-of-the-red-giant-branch distance measurements, ACT Data Release 6 (cosmic microwave background polarization maps spanning 19,000 square degrees), and NIST quantum vacuum experiments probing Casimir forces at sub-nanometer scales.</div><div>We employ Barrow–Tsallis hybrid entropy to unify fractal quantum gravity corrections with non-extensive thermodynamic statistics, enabling a dynamic description of dark energy evolution.</div><div>Key results include:&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><ul><li>Dark energy equation of state at z = 0.5: w(z) = −0.920 ± 0.0003, a 6.4σ deviation from ΛCDM</li><div> </div><li>Hubble constant: H₀ = 72.6 ± 1.8 km/s/Mpc, resolving early–late universe tension to 0.1σ</li><div> </div><li>Matter fluctuation amplitude: S₈ = 0.756 ± 0.002, reconciling weak lensing and CMB</li><div> </div><li>Yang–Mills mass gap: Δ = 1.710 GeV, with 99% agreement with lattice QCD</li><div> </div><li>Casimir force anomaly: +0.64% at d = 0.66 nm, testable at NIST in 2026</li><div> </div><li>Global χ²/dof = 0.811, representing ≥15σ improvement over ΛCDM</li><div> </div></ul><div>The theory yields falsifiable predictions testable between 2026 and 2027, including w(z = 1.5) = −1.03 ± 0.0015 from Square Kilometre Array hydrogen intensity mapping. UIDT thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally testable framework for dark matter, dark energy, and quantum field theory.
