\section{2. Theoretical Foundations of UIDT}
\subsection{2.1 The Information-Density Field}
\label{igw}

UIDT postulates that information density $S(x)$ is the primary ontological entity, with
dimensions $[S] = [k_B / l^3]$, where $k_B$ is Boltzmann’s constant and $l$ is length. The
field satisfies a Lorentz-covariant action:
[ \mathcal{S} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \gamma \ell_P^2 (\nabla_\mu S
\nabla^\mu S) - V(S) + \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} \right], ]
where $\ell_P$ is the Planck length, $\gamma$ is a dimensionless coupling, $V(S) =
\frac{1}{2} m_S^2 S^2 + \frac{\eta}{4} S^4$ is the potential, and $\mathcal{L}{\text{int}} =
\lambda S \Tr(F{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu})$ couples $S$ to Yang-Mills fields. The vacuum
expectation $\expect{S} = S_0$ breaks symmetries, generating masses.
The core equation of UIDT is:
[ m_{\eff}^2 = m^2 + \gamma \frac{k_B^2}{c^4} \nabla_\mu S \nabla^\mu S, ]
derived from variation of the action, where the gradient term induces effective masses from
information fluctuations.
